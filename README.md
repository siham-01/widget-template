# HTML Widget Page

## What To Do

In `assets/src/html/widget.html`, create a simple, interactive webpage—a "widget page"—that abstractly teaches 6th graders how to store and change a value in a variable.

Starter code is provided for you in the `widget.html` file. Read the documentation in the `docs/` folder to familiarize yourself with the provided code.

## Getting Started

Create a copy of this template repository, which you'll use to save and [submit](#submission) your work.

## Requirements

As part of your widget page...

- Create and embed a new widget that includes at least one interactive element (button, slider, input field, etc.)
- Provide visual feedback when the user interacts (something changes on screen)
- Write simple explanation text appropriate for 6th graders
- Ensure your code works in a modern browser (Chrome/Firefox/Safari)
- Follow the framework and style guidelines in the `docs/` folder
- Keep your code simple—no more than 150 lines total

## Example

See a (longer) example widget page in `assets/src/html/introduction-to-programming.html`. Your widget page should be much shorter: the intent is simply to show you what a full widget page looks like.

## Submission

Ensure your repository is publicly viewable. Then, share the link to your public GitHub repository in your application.

**We will only use your submission for review purposes. Your submission will not be utilized in any curriculum product.**

## Timing

Creating your widget should take 2 hours or less. Do not spend more than 3 hours.
